 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const jobData: ParsedJobData = {

 *   company: "Tech Corp", 
 *   location: "San Francisco, California",
 *   experienceRequired: "3-5 years",

 * - **starting:** Initial setup and validation, typically <100ms
 * - **processing:** Active AI service communication, typically 2-5 seconds
