- company (company name)
- location (job location in the format "city, province/state" with no abbreviations, e.g., "Toronto, Ontario")
- experienceRequired (years of experience required, otherwise "Not specified")
- skills (array of key skills mentioned, maximum 6)
- remote (boolean - true if remote work is mentioned)
- notes (comprehensive summary that captures ALL important information including responsibilities, requirements, nice-to-haves, benefits, and any other relevant details. Be thorough but concise)

IMPORTANT: Your response MUST be ONLY a valid JSON object. DO NOT include any other text, backticks, or markdown formatting.
IMPORTANT: For the location field, strictly use the format "city, province/state" with no abbreviations (e.g., "Toronto, Ontario", not "Toronto, ON" or "Toronto, Canada").` as const;
